Thanks to Matias for his blessings on the project.

And also thanks to:
- The authors of Vala, for a great programming language that brings the power
  and universality of C to a modern, easy to learn C#-like language.
- The authors of waf for an easy to use, intuitive build system.
- The members of the various IRC channels that helped me on my way with Vala
  and waf.
- The authors of XFCE for a great desktop environment.
- The authors of the Vala bindings for XFCE, without which this port would not
  be possible.
